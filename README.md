## Final Project

The final project for CSCI432 requires students to create a web-based platform that adapts Robert's Rules of Order (RONR) for digital use. Because RONR was initially intended for in-person meetings, students will introduce necessary variations to support both physical committee meetings and fully offline, asynchronous discussions. Working in groups of 2-4, each team will design their platform tailored to what needs the team wants to address.

COMPLETED:

- User registration, login, and name change.

INCOMPLETE:

- Changing other properties, like short-bio, phone number, address, and profile picture, are optional.
- Creating a committee, adding users to a committee.
- Role control of users (e.g., owner, chair, member, and optionally observer). Fine-grained authentication control (e.g., create motion, discussion, move to vote, vote) is optional.
- Control panel for chairs to toggle some styles.
- Raise motion (title and description).
- Raise motions that decide to change the procedure (typically required 2/3 vote to pass).
- One or both of the feature
  - For offline discussion, motions can be replied to and discussed. Each reply should have a pro/con/neutral selection.
  - For in-person or video-conference discussions, members can raise their hands with a pro/con tag. The chair can decide who can speak, usually alternating between the pros and cons.
- Vote on motions (anonymously or with names recorded).
- Recording of previous decisions with the recording of the whole discussion and allowing the chair to write a summary of why the decision is made and the pros/cons of the decision for future reference.
- Raise motions that overturn previous decisions. Only the member who voted in favor of the vote can overturn previous decisions.
- Raise sub-motions, like revisions of the previous motion, and postpone the decision.
- Special motions that do not need or cannot be discussed.
- Proper documentation and prototyping of the website.
